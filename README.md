# My Next.js App

Welcome to Charu's Next.js App! This project demonstrates how to build a Next.js application with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG).

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. You can check if it's installed by running:

```bash
node -v
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-nextjs-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd my-nextjs-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server to view the app in your browser:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application in action.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Fetches data on the server before sending it to the client.
- Static Site Generation (SSG): Generates static pages at build time.
